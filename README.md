# Project-1-Face-Recognition-Gender-Classification-
This project focuses on gender classification using face recognition techniques, leveraging the CelebA dataset. It involves experimenting with three popular deep learning algorithms: VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, to determine the best model for gender classification.

## Overview:
In this digital era, face recognition technology is growing rapidly and is being applied in various fields. One of its applications is gender classification, which is identifying the gender of a person from an image or video. This technology has great potential to improve security and efficiency in various applications, such as attendance systems, access control, demographic analysis, and others.
